# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
    Our team will meet once a week every Saturday from 3-5 PM using Zoom. Our team decides to take notes for meetings by taking turns.

2. **Assistance** 
    Each team member can be contacted through email and WeChat. Outside of emergencies or other commitments, we commit to responding to emails within 24 hours.

3. **Respect** 
On each weekly meeting, one of the team member will be the "meeting host" to ensure the courtesy and respect among all members. We give every people an opportunity to try writing the method, and apply the best one by agreement of the majority for the final version. By signing this document, each member of the team commits to adhering to the decisions made, even if they may personally disagree with them. The final decision will be followed by all members of the group.

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
We will discuss each part before we start, and try to assign seperate part to different person equally. When we have unexpected complications or unforeseen work, we will try to discuss it first, and try to gather some information from internet. On each meeting, there will be only one commiter to commit code to github for preventing errors on merging.

5. **Time Commitment** 
We will work on the project no less than 6 hours weekly. We need to tell each other 3 days before the meeting date. If only one person cannot meeting on time, we will meet as usual. Otherwise, we will try to assign a different time to meet.
6. **Conflict Resolution** 
Conflicts will be solved in zoom meetings to ensure good communication. Discussions and votes are used as described in the Respect part of this contract. When the issue is debatable or unsolvable, team members are encouraged to ask staff members for help via Queue@Illinois, and Discord.
